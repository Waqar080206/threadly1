# Threadly

![Threadly Logo](./public/brand/logocolor.png)

**A Chief and a Crew of AI specialists that keep every relationship you've ever made alive, warm, and queryable.**

Threadly is a relationship intelligence platform built on a shared graph architecture. The frontend is a Next.js app and the backend is a FastAPI service connected to Firebase Authentication, Neo4j Aura, and Groq. The goal is a stable demo where every live feature works end to end.

## 🎯 What is Threadly?

Five AI specialists manage every relationship in the background. One Chief answers questions across the whole graph.

- **Chief** - Master Connect: Ask your relationship graph anything in plain English
- **Snap** - Business cards → enriched contacts in seconds
- **Nudge** - Secret cues trigger perfectly-timed follow-ups
- **Gatekeeper** - Inbound screening + qualification
- **Pulse** - DMs from Instagram, X, Telegram in real time
- **Recall** - Voice notes → structured memory + follow-ups

### Live MVP

The current MVP supports:

- Google / email auth through Firebase
- User sync from Firebase into Neo4j
- Live Crew actions through `POST /crew/action`
- Scanner contact capture into the graph
- Chief-style answers on the Connect page
- Dashboard stats backed by Neo4j queries

### Three Tiers

| Tier | Use Case | Scale |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Solo** | Individual operators, creators, founders | One voice, one graph |
| **Teams** | Founders, BD, IR, community leads | Shared team graph, 4-20 people |
| **Enterprise** | VCs, family offices, holding companies | Portfolio networks, strict entity walls |

## 🔌 Runtime Environment

### Frontend

Set these in Vercel:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` - deployed FastAPI base URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID`

### Backend

Set these in the FastAPI environment:

- `NEO4J_URI`
- `NEO4J_USERNAME`
- `NEO4J_PASSWORD`
- `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
- `GROQ_API_KEY`
- `CORS_ORIGINS` - comma-separated allowed frontend origins

---

## 🎨 Design System

**Brand Colors:**
- Indigo (Chief) - `#3d4e7e`
- Coral (Snap) - `#e85a3c`
- Teal (Nudge) - `#2d7d7a`
- Copper (Gatekeeper) - `#c07a2c`
- Indigo (Pulse) - `#3d4e7e`
- Sage (Recall) - `#7b9a8d`

**Typography:**
- Editorial: Brand-forward serif font
- Mono: System monospace for UI labels

**Spacing:** 8px base unit (Tailwind)

**Product UI:**

---

### Auth Notes

- Authentication uses Firebase on the frontend
- Backend requests are authenticated with Firebase ID tokens
- The backend verifies the token before querying Neo4j
- The deployed frontend origin must be allowed in backend CORS
